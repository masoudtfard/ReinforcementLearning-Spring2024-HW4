# Reinforcement Learning - HW4 - Spring 2024
## Sharif University of Technology
### CQL, Inverse RL, Model-Based RL, Multi-armed Bandit

This repository contains my solutions for the 4th assignment of the Reinforcement Learning course (CE957) at Sharif University of Technology. This assignment consists of two parts: theoretical and practical.

#### Theoretical Part

- **Conservative Q-Learning**
- **Inverse RL**: Discusses the properties of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Maximum Entropy Inverse RL.
- **Model-Based RL**: Analyzes properties Model-Based Policy Optimization, Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning, and Conservative Offline Model-Based Policy Optimization.
- **Multi-armed Bandit**

#### Practical Part

- **RL_PHW4_MasoudTahmasbi_402200275.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the Online and Offline Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithms and Behavioral Cloning in the [CartPole-v1](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) environment.
